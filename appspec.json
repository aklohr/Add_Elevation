Depending on your required data property and how the animal(s) behave during the gap (e.g. night - flying or not?) either one or the other might be sensible. Note that (in addition to the Time Lag Between Locations App) you need to add the Adapt Time Lag for Regular Gaps App to your workflow before, if you want to use this feature.",
